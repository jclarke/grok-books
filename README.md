# hpbooks

A local, encrypted bookkeeping app for a small business and a household. It imports bank and card transactions, classifies them with rules you control, and produces a profit-and-loss statement, cash flow, vendor and tax-prep reports, from the command line or a web UI on your own machine. A separate **Personal** mode in the same database covers personal accounts: net worth, spending, budgets, recurring charges, bills, and goals.

Nothing leaves the machine. The database is SQLCipher-encrypted, the web server listens on `127.0.0.1` only, and the app makes no third-party requests. The product name shown in the UI comes from your config (default "Books").

## Use it with Grok Bot

hpbooks is a private bookkeeping app that runs on your own computer: business books, personal finances, or both, in one encrypted database.

**1. Ask Grok Bot to install it.** Paste this into a chat:

```text
Install the books app from https://github.com/jclarke/grok-books on your computer and set it up for me.
```

Grok Bot clones the repository, creates the database key (it never shows the key or puts it in chat), writes your config, creates the database, starts the web app, and runs the tests. The checklist it follows is in [Installing with an AI assistant](#installing-with-an-ai-assistant).

**2. Answer a few questions.** Before it creates the database, Grok Bot asks for:

- Your company name, shown in the sidebar and on P&L titles.
- Your timezone, so scheduled syncs and update checks run at sensible times.
- Business, personal, or both. Each mode is a switch in the config.
- Your businesses and categories, if you keep business books. These are fixed when the database is created.
- Which bank and card accounts to bring in, from the Finance connector you have linked in Grok Bot. New accounts start as personal; any of them can be moved to business.

**3. Use it day to day.** Just ask:

| Ask Grok Bot | What happens |
|---|---|
| "Sync my books" | Pulls the last 10 days for every linked account through the Finance connector, imports it (re-imports never duplicate), and refreshes balances. See [sync/README.md](sync/README.md). |
| "Sync Stripe" | Pulls balance transactions and payouts from the Stripe connector for each configured account, imports them, and matches payouts to bank deposits. Only when Stripe is turned on. See [docs/stripe.md](docs/stripe.md). |
| "Show me my P&L for September" | Profit and loss by month or by business, with owner draws below the line. |
| "What's uncategorized?" | The review queue, largest first, with suggestions. A fix can be saved as a rule so the same merchant is handled next time. |
| "When are my cards due?" | Minimum payments, due dates, and APRs for every card and loan, soonest first. See [docs/payment-tracking.md](docs/payment-tracking.md). |
| "How's my spending this month?" | Personal spending by category, budgets, and recurring charges. See [docs/personal-mode.md](docs/personal-mode.md). |
| "Export a PDF report" | The P&L as a PDF; CSV and XLSX work too. |
| "Check for updates" | Runs `bin/hpbooks update check` and tells you what is new. It updates only when you say so. See [Updates](#updates). |

Grok Bot can also run the sync and the update check every day on a schedule; the update check stays quiet unless there is a new version ([docs/update-routine.md](docs/update-routine.md)).

**4. Open the web app.** On the computer where the books run, go to <http://127.0.0.1:8765>. The **Business | Personal** toggle in the header switches modes. To open it from your laptop or phone, ask Grok Bot to "set up Tailscale for my books": the app stays on `127.0.0.1`, Tailscale forwards a private tailnet port to it, and a passphrase is required. See [Remote access with Tailscale](#remote-access-with-tailscale-optional).

The app itself makes no network calls for ledger data: Grok Bot saves what the Finance connector returns as files on that computer, and hpbooks imports those files into the encrypted database.

## Features

- **Import** aggregator pulls (JSON or CSV tool results), Capital One CSVs, Apple Card CSVs, store-card statement PDFs, and Monarch exports. Every import is idempotent; pending rows are matched to their posted versions. See [docs/importers.md](docs/importers.md).
- **Classify** with priority-ordered regex rules, one-click "create rule from this", a review inbox with suggestions, bulk edits with undo, and transfer matching between accounts. Manual decisions are never overwritten.
- **Report**: P&L by month or business (with owner draws below the line), P&L by business, cash flow, expenses by vendor, owner draws, a Schedule C aid, and a reconciliation that ties raw activity to net income. CSV, XLSX, and PDF exports.
- **Balances** from statement anchors, account registers with running balances, and vendor merges that never rewrite the ledger.
- **Personal mode**: separate categories and rules, transfer pairing, budgets with rollover, recurring and subscription detection, bills, goals, net worth history, monthly summary. See [docs/personal-mode.md](docs/personal-mode.md).
- **Several businesses** in one ledger, each a tag with its own label and colour.
- **Optional WHMCS integration** for hosting businesses: revenue, MRR, churn, collections, gateway reconciliation, server margins. See [docs/whmcs.md](docs/whmcs.md).
- **Optional Stripe integration**: gross revenue, refunds, disputes, and Stripe fees booked per business from Stripe balance transactions, with each payout matched to its bank deposit so revenue counts once. See [docs/stripe.md](docs/stripe.md).
- **Optional remote access** over Tailscale with a host allowlist and passphrase sign-in.
- Audit log of every edit.

## Requirements

- Linux or macOS with Python 3.11+ (`python3 -m venv`).
- Node 20+ and npm, only to rebuild the web UI (the built app is committed).
- Python packages in `requirements.txt` (SQLCipher bindings via `sqlcipher3-binary`, Flask, openpyxl, reportlab, PyMySQL, pytest).
- Optional: `pdftotext` (poppler-utils) for the statement importers; `ripgrep` for `scripts/privacy_scan.sh`.

## Install

```bash
git clone <this repository> books && cd books

# Python
python3 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt

# Web UI (optional: hpbooks/static/app is already built)
(cd web && npm ci)
bin/build-ui --no-install

# Database key: 64 hex characters in a mode-600 file
mkdir -p ~/.config/hpbooks && chmod 700 ~/.config/hpbooks
( umask 077; python3 -c 'import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))' > ~/.config/hpbooks/key )
chmod 600 ~/.config/hpbooks/key

# Site config (optional; without it you get the generic defaults)
cp config/config.example.toml config/local.toml
chmod 600 config/local.toml
$EDITOR config/local.toml      # product and company name, businesses, categories (decide before init)

# Create the database and start the web UI
bin/hpbooks init
bin/hpbooks-web start          # http://127.0.0.1:8765
```

**Back up the key.** Without it the database cannot be opened. Keep a copy somewhere safe and separate from database backups.

`bin/hpbooks` runs `.venv/bin/python -m hpbooks`; `bin/hpbooks --help` lists every command. `bin/hpbooks-web start|stop|status` runs the server in the background (log and pid in `data/`); `bin/hpbooks web` runs it in the foreground. The database is `data/hpbooks.db` unless `HPBOOKS_DB` or `[paths] db` says otherwise. Business tags and categories become database constraints at `init`, so set them in the config first. See [docs/configuration.md](docs/configuration.md).

## First steps

```bash
bin/hpbooks accounts discover finance_list_accounts.json --dry-run   # register accounts from a saved account list
bin/hpbooks accounts set-scope <id|last4|name> business               # new accounts start as personal
bin/hpbooks import sync/inbox/2026-10-01/                             # load transactions
bin/hpbooks review --year 2026                                        # what still needs a decision
bin/hpbooks classify <txn-id-prefix> --tag general --category "Software & Licenses" --rule
bin/hpbooks pnl --year 2026 --by month
bin/hpbooks reconcile --year 2026
```

Most of this is easier in the web UI: the Review page, inline classification on Transactions, and "Create rule from this". The daily pull routine for an agent is in [sync/README.md](sync/README.md).

## Remote access with Tailscale (optional)

The server always binds to loopback. To reach it from your other devices, let Tailscale Serve forward a tailnet port to it, allowlist the host names you will type, and set a passphrase:

```bash
tailscale serve --bg --tcp 8765 tcp://127.0.0.1:8765     # check `tailscale serve --help` for your version
bin/hpbooks web-passphrase set                           # at least 12 characters; stored as a scrypt hash
bin/hpbooks-web stop
bin/hpbooks web --allow-host <machine>.<tailnet-domain> --allow-host <tailnet-ip>   # saves data/allowed-hosts (mode 600); Ctrl-C
bin/hpbooks-web start                                    # passes the saved hosts on every start
```

You can also edit `data/allowed-hosts` directly (one host per line, mode 600). Each host name signs in separately. With no passphrase set, allowlisted hosts get `503` and the books stay closed. Details: [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

## WHMCS (optional)

Set `whmcs = true` under `[features]` and fill in `[whmcs]` and one `[[whmcs.brands]]` per install in `config/local.toml`, put the read-only MySQL password in `data/whmcs.secret` (mode 600), then `bin/hpbooks whmcs sync`. Setup, grants, and report definitions: [docs/whmcs.md](docs/whmcs.md).

## Stripe (optional)

Set `stripe = true` under `[features]` and add one `[[stripe.accounts]]` per Stripe account (its name and business, and optionally the `acct_` id) in `config/local.toml`. Grok Bot saves the Stripe connector's balance transactions and payouts to `sync/inbox/YYYY-MM-DD/stripe/`, and `bin/hpbooks import sync/inbox/YYYY-MM-DD/` books them: gross revenue and fees per business, refunds and disputes against revenue, payouts as transfers paired with the bank deposits. Check payouts with `bin/hpbooks stripe reconcile`. Booking rules, the connector steps, and the optional direct-API mode: [docs/stripe.md](docs/stripe.md).

## Updates

Installs follow the public snapshot repository (`[update]` in the config: `repo`, `remote`, `branch`; defaults `jclarke/grok-books`, `public`, `main`). A git remote with the `remote` name is used when the clone has one; otherwise the repository URL.

```bash
git remote add public https://github.com/jclarke/grok-books.git   # once, if the clone lacks it
bin/hpbooks update check          # exit 0 up to date, 1 update available, 2 error
bin/hpbooks update apply          # dry run: lists the new commits, changes nothing
bin/hpbooks update apply --yes    # git fetch + git merge --ff-only
bin/hpbooks-web stop && bin/hpbooks-web start   # load the new code
```

What is preserved: everything git ignores, which an update never writes: `config/local.toml`, `config/*.local.*`, `data/` (the database, key, logs, allowlist), keys and secrets, `.venv`, `sync/inbox/`, and exports. `apply` refuses when tracked files have uncommitted changes, when your clone has commits of its own (it only fast-forwards), or when upstream would change a protected path. The built UI in `hpbooks/static/app` arrives with the update; `--build-ui` also runs `bin/build-ui --no-install` when `web/` changed. If `requirements.txt` changed, run `.venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt`.

An install unpacked from a zip (no `.git`) is checked through the GitHub API (`gh` when installed, else `GITHUB_TOKEN` if set) against the revision in `.hpbooks-revision`; `apply --yes` downloads the branch and overlays it, skipping the same protected paths. Files deleted upstream are not removed from a zip install.

To be told about updates, see [docs/update-routine.md](docs/update-routine.md).

## Tests

```bash
.venv/bin/pytest                                 # Python; temporary database and key per test
HPBOOKS_TEST_WHMCS=off .venv/bin/pytest          # same, with the WHMCS feature off
(cd web && npm test && npm run typecheck)        # Vitest + tsc
```

Tests never open your real database. `tests/golden/` holds expected output for a fake ledger; regenerate it with `.venv/bin/python tests/make_golden.py` only for an intended change.

## Installing with an AI assistant

If an assistant (Claude Code or similar) sets this up for you, give it this checklist:

1. Clone, create `.venv`, `pip install -r requirements.txt`. Do not run `npm` unless the UI must be rebuilt.
2. Create the key file exactly as above. Never print, log, or commit the key; never paste it into chat.
3. Copy `config/config.example.toml` to `config/local.toml` and ask the user for the company name, businesses, and categories **before** `bin/hpbooks init`.
4. Run `bin/hpbooks init`, `bin/hpbooks-web start`, and check `curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8765/api/session`.
5. Run `.venv/bin/pytest -q` to confirm the install.
6. Never commit `data/`, `config/local.toml`, `config/*.local.*`, `sync/inbox/`, or exports, and never bind the server to anything but `127.0.0.1`.
7. For remote access, follow the Tailscale section and set a passphrase before allowlisting a host.

## Maintainers: publishing

This repository is published from a private working copy as scanned snapshots, so the public history never contains private commits. One-time: `git remote add public <url>`, `git config publish.name` / `publish.email`, and three local deny lists in `config/` (or `HPBOOKS_PRIVACY_DIR`). Then:

```bash
scripts/publish.sh            # dry run: export, privacy scan, show what would be published
scripts/publish.sh --push     # publish a new snapshot commit to public/main
```

See [docs/publishing.md](docs/publishing.md).
