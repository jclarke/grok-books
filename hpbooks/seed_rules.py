"""Initial classification rules. Loaded idempotently by pattern + field + account + sign.

A fresh install gets a small set of generic starter rules (payouts, card and
bank fees, interest, common SaaS, tax payments, card payments, ads, insurance,
travel) written for the default categories. A site can add
its own list, with account ids and business tags, in a JSON file named by
`[seed] rules_file` in the config; `starter_rules = false` drops the starters.

Two rules may share a pattern but differ by amount sign, so the idempotency
key includes amount_sign. Otherwise a re-seed would keep only the inflow rule
and book processor fees as revenue.
