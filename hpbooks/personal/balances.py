"""Personal account balances on any date, from balance anchors plus ledger activity.

Method (the same anchor idea as hpbooks/balances.py, extended to history):

- A row moves an account by its amount (cash, investment, other assets) or by
  minus its amount (cards and loans, whose balance is the amount owed).
- On a date with an anchor on or before it, the balance is the latest such
  anchor plus every active row dated after that anchor through the date
  (pending rows included, since a posted anchor does not contain them).
- On a date before the first anchor, the first anchor is walked back by the
  posted rows between the date and the anchor.
- With no anchor, the balance is the running sum of imported activity.

Investment accounts change with the market, which the ledger does not record,
so between anchors their history carries the earlier anchor forward plus
contributions; a new anchor steps the line to the provider's value.
